# Chapter 2
## Testing the Datatable

Before further development I will add some tests.  There isn't much functionality to test yet but by adding tests as I add functionality it will make it less daunting later to have a large and completey untested component.  Also, the tests will ensure that functionality does not accidently drift as development continues.

The tests will mostly be very simplistic; just determining that the table initializes in the correct state and that the `getData` member correctly resolves various cases of `path` and `row` values.

For now the main test is the final one, `'should render the table correctly'`, which sets the `data` and `columns` `Input`s to testing values then verifies that the table rendered with the correct elements and the correct values were put into the elements.

Some of these tests are probably superfluous and I may end up removing them.  But for now I will leave them in as they give a starting point for testing future development and can be easily removed if I determine they are not needed.
