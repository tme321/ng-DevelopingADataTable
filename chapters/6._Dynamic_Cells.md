# Chapter 6
## Dynamic Cells

As the table is model driven cell templating is better handled with dynamic components than custom html templates.  This also has the convenient side effect of making it easier to reuse a component displaying a table as the table in the view is generic and can be passed arbitrary models.

For the dynamic components specifically I am going to pull in my [Dynamic View Kit library](https://github.com/tme321/UAT-DynamicViewKit/) as it includes a fleshed out dynamic component handler implementation.  The dvk will also afford me other possibilities for the future like animations but for now the only part I'm interested in is the dynamic components functionality.
