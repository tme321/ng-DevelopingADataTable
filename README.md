# Developing an Angular Component by Example

The goal of this repo is to document the development process of an Angular component.  Each branch will represent a specific development snapshot that shows the evolution of the component from the initial stages to a version that is suitable for actual use.

The component to be developed will be a datatable.  As development progresses some elements of the datatable will very likely be moved to their own components but the initial design will focus on a single component representing the entire table.
